#+title: A Julia + SDL software to simulate reaction diffusion models

Pygame was too slow, so I tried using Julia + SDL2.

/!\ Code is crude, and not well optimized. 

* Installation
- clone the repo
- open Julia
- ~] activate .~
- ~] instantiate~

* Usage
- choose the correct update function:
  1. usual Gray-Scott model
  2. modified Gray-Scott model (no interesting dynamics)
  3. noisy Gray-Scott model (the parameter Î± controls the noise
     strength)
- run ~julia --project=. main.jl~
- shortcuts:
  - =r=: reset the density
  - =s=: save the density to the file =rho.dat= (see DelimitedFiles format)
  - =l=: load the density from the file =rho.dat=
