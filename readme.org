#+title: A Julia + SDL software to simulate reaction diffusion models

Pygame was too slow, so I tried using Julia + SDL2. What a ride though !

* Plan for next time
- convert reaction diffusion space to pixels (hopefully fast)
- implement RD time evolution

* Julia + SDL2 notes
- conversion between SDL2 names and Julia names: =SDL_CreateWindow= =>
  =SDL2.CreateWindow=, if we defined ~const SDL2 = SimpleDirectMediaLayer~
- use ~C_NULL~ for C NULL (of course)
- use =ColorTypes= and =ARGB32= for colors, that's much easier
  (automatically converts to =UInt32=)
- to get a pointer to the data of a Julia array: the ~pointer~ method
- sleep introduces delay in the treatment of the events. Use
  =SDL2.Delay= instead
